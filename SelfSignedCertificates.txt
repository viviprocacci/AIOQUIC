Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

First fill out the openssl.cnf file
Template should be in the folder.
You should only need to modify the IP address in two places.
Get the IP using linux command "hostname -I"

Generate the private key and the CSR:

openssl req -new -nodes -out myserver.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -config openssl.cnf

Now you need to sign the CSR:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in myserver.csr -signkey myserver.key -out myserver.crt -extensions req_ext -extfile openssl.cnf




To start the server:  
##Note that the path to the .crt and the .key are specified sperately
##Remember to change them both if you want to use a different set of keys and certs

python examples/http3_server.py --certificate fgcucerts/myserver.crt --private-key fgcucerts/myserver.key


Client side command:
##Make sure to change the IP to the IP signed in the certificates (the one the server should be on)

python examples/http3_client.py --ca-certs /path/to/myserver.crt https://10.100.87.206:4433/

//You will need to change the IP addresses
